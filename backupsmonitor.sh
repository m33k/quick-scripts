# Description: Check if backup drive is 85% full or higher then send email to notify. Run's nightly 
# Version: 0.1

# Start of Script

# Variable Declarations


# assign backup usage variable and cut out percent
# compare it to 85 using -gt
# then send out email to level2 for them to check into it.
# future may want to check disk usage of both main partition and backup drive
# this script also needs to check if the last nights backups failed and if so then send email to level2. 
# cron for script needs to run after backups
# script could also notify level2 if backups are still running after 12-16 hours
# Title could be like: [server.ondine.net.co] FAILED â›”: httpd (198.136.49.170)
# use ansible to deploy the script


# Part 1 of Backups Monitor

# Part 2 of Backups Monitor

# Backups running on system
BACKUPPROC=$(ps -elF | grep cpanel/bin/backup | grep -v grep | wc -l)
# If backup is still running alert level2 and tell them backups have been running for this many hours.
# idea: check the head of backup log and capture the time backups started. Get current time and do some math and print how long backups have been running. 
# now if backups have been running for over x (7) hours, alert level2




# Part 3 of Backups Monitor (Partial & Full Failure)
# tail latest backup log and if backup log matches PartialFailure string send alert to level2 so they can look into it.
# Need to find a way to say this: check latest backup log for this string and if it mataches send failure email
